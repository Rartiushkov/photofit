This repository contains a minimal Android application skeleton. The app is intended to analyze food photos using the CalorieMama API.

## Building

Open the project in Android Studio and run the `app` module on an Android device or emulator. The `CalorieMamaApi` class is a placeholder where API calls should be implemented.
