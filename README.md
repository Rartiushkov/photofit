# photofit

This project provides a simple Android application that analyzes food photos with the Spoonacular Food API. Select an image and the app uploads it to Spoonacular to retrieve information about the pictured food and its nutrition.

## Building

Open the project in Android Studio and run the `app` module on an emulator or device. Network requests require an API key which is included in the sample code for demonstration.
